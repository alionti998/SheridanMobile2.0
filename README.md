# Sheridan Mobile 2.0
Sheridan Mobile 2.0 Capstone Project<br>
***Only commit/push changes to the master branch that are at least somewhat stable. Do not push anything overly buggy/app breaking.

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for "Sheridan Mobile 2.0". Sheridan Mobile 2.0 is an Android replacement for the current old official app "Sheridan Mobile"
available for Android and iOS. The current app is dated, broken, feature deprived and does not live up to the Sheridan name. Sheridan Mobile has so much potential.

We are building an unofficial "Sheridan Mobile 2.0" that Sheridan students, faculty, administration and prospective students will find useful and will want to use on a daily basis.

Features our app will have are:
- Live news feed along with alerts and events
- Real-time notifications and notification topics
- Sheridan campus maps
- Real-time chat with an adviser
- SLATE and email built in to the app
- Login with school credentials for a more personalized experience
*features are subject to change

Improvements from official app:
- Security: many portions of app will be secured with https and valid security certificate
- Modern: App will use modern technologies used today for a better experience
- Improved JAVACAM experience
- Google Analytics will be used to see how users interact with the app
- Real-time fatal crash data via Firebase

Technologies to be used:
- Core: Android studio for app development and features
- Firebase: Will be used to enhance the app and bring additional features such as notifications and web hosting (see https://firebase.google.com/)
- Web app integration: Will be used to deliver active content

***This list is not final. Check back for more updates
